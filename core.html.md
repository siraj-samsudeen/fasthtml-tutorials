### Utils

In Jupyter, we want to restart the kernel and Run All to run all the
cells. But we need to remember to stop the server before doing Run All,
otherwise Port will NOT be free and the server will not be able to
start. Hence, we wrote an utility function to check whether the server
is in the global namespace and then stop it.

Stopping the server takes a bit of time - so, we need to wait for the
port to be free. We tried to use
[`fasthtml.jupyter.wait_port_free()`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/fasthtml/api/jupyter.html#wait_port_free)
but this also did not work. Hence, we are doing a hack of just sleeping
for 0.1 second, which works for now.

In Jupyter, we need to run the `show(picocondlink)` in a seperate cell
to add styling to the pico components.

In order for the pico components to display correctly we need to add
“pico” as a class to the element and there is a in-build function that
does this called `set_pico_cls()` but for some reason it is not working,
I’ve checked this function on the vscode and jupyterlab.

Hence, we created our own function that wraps the element in a div with
the class “pico”.
